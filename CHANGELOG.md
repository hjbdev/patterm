## [Unreleased]

The first public release, planned as 0.1.0. Earlier development history stays
in the archived pre-release repository.

### Added

- Optional saved memory for the assistant, enabled in Settings › Assistant.
  A bounded snapshot keeps useful facts across fresh conversations, with
  approximately 2,000, 4,000 or 8,000 tokens of space. Low, medium and high
  importance slow forgetting by different amounts; older notes can be
  compressed repeatedly. Native conversation compaction stays in Codex.
- Agents in Integrated mode can put figures in their replies. The new
  `ui_save` tool takes a claim and a figure: a chart (bar, line, area, point,
  interval or cell, with reference lines, bands, events and regions), a table,
  a diagram (flow, sequence or nested boxes, laid out by Patterm, with
  optional Back/Next steps), stats, steps, a choice, or a screenshot from the
  agent's working directory. It returns a reference such as
  `[patterm_figure:pipeline]`; the agent puts it on its own line in its reply
  and the figure is drawn there, between paragraphs. The call itself stays in
  the tool group, where expanding it also shows the figure. Agents send data
  and meanings, such as `tone: "warn"` or `state: "projected"`; Patterm picks
  colours, scales and layout, so figures match the app. Figures can carry
  sliders, and their numbers can be arithmetic formulas over them. A choice
  with `ask` sends your pick back to the agent as an ordinary message, only
  from the window in control, and stays answered when the conversation
  reloads. Figures can show their source and never run agent code. Bad input
  is rejected with the exact path to fix. Charts use TanStack Charts, loaded
  with the first figure. Only Integrated agents are offered `ui_save`.
  Settings › Figures turns it off and shows example figures.
- An Electron desktop app and a Linux browser service that host Claude Code,
  Codex, opencode, and Amp through PTYs, keeping each CLI's own permissions,
  delegation, and resume.
- A Rust terminal sidecar built on `alacritty_terminal`, drawn by a WebGPU
  renderer with a WebGL fallback.
- Projects that hold agents, processes, worktrees, diffs, imported conversation
  history, todos, and scratchpads.
- MCP tools that let agents spawn and message sub-agents, report to their
  parent, set timers, and manage todos, scratchpads, references, worktrees, and
  routines.
- Paired hosts, so agents on a second machine appear beside local ones.
- Linux release tarballs with bundled Node and Electron, a signed release
  manifest, and `curl | bash` install, update, and uninstall scripts.

### Changed

- Every Patterm tool name is now snake_case, such as `todo_list`, `ui_save`
  and `session_context`, so agents see the same name in every harness and can
  pass it to `help`. The dotted names, such as `todo.list`, are gone. Paired
  hosts must run the same version to read each other.
- Code blocks and diffs highlight a fixed set of common languages; other
  languages show as plain text. Patterm no longer bundles Shiki's GPL-3.0
  grammars and theme.

### Fixed

- `/new` in the assistant starts a fresh conversation with empty context.

- Stopping a terminal no longer fails when one of its processes exits while
  Patterm is reading its details from `/proc`.
- A Codex agent no longer keeps showing as working after a turn that ended
  immediately.
